// Cantor’s Diagonalization - This approach constructs a binary string that is guaranteed to be different from all strings innumsusing Cantor’s diagonalization technique. O(n)

// it works by constructing a new number that is guaranteed to not be in a given list of numbers by systematically changing each digit on the diagonal of the list, essentially creating a number that differs from every number in the list. list is of length n only which is a length of each number also
